### 3. **Configuration & Setup**
- âœ… Created proper `.env` file with your API key: `[SECURED - API key moved to environment variables]`
- âœ… Added comprehensive README with setup instructions
- âœ… Created startup scripts for Windows (`start-backend.bat`, `start-frontend.bat`)
- âœ… Added verification script to check project setup
- âœ… Fixed all dependency issues

### 4. **Code Quality**

### 2. **Verification System**
- `verify-setup.py` script that checks:
  - Python package installations
  - Directory structure
  - Environment variables
  - API key validity
  - Node.js dependencies
  - Backend import functionality

### 3. **Improved Documentation**
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- API endpoint documentation
- Troubleshooting guide
- Getting started instructions

### 4. **Startup Scripts**
- Windows batch files for easy server startup
- Simplified development workflow

## API Integration Status

### âœ… Working Endpoints
- `/signup` - User registration
- `/login` - User authentication
- `/upload-slide` - File upload
- `/slides` - List uploaded files
- `/slides/<filename>` - Serve/download files
- `/slides/<filename>` (DELETE) - Delete files
- `/generate-summary` - AI-powered summary generation
- `/generate-quiz` - AI-powered quiz generation
- `/fetch-resources` - Get related learning resources

### ðŸ”§ API Configuration

- Gemini API key configured

### Quick Start
1. **Start Backend**: Run `start-backend.bat` or `python Backend/server.py`
2. **Start Frontend**: Run `start-frontend.bat` or navigate to `FrontEnd/ai-study-planner` and run `npm start`
3. **Verify Setup**: Run `python verify-setup.py` to check everything is working

### URLs
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:5000

## Support

The project is now fully functional and ready for use. All major issues have been resolved, and the codebase follows modern best practices for React and Flask applications.

If you encounter any issues, check:
1. Run `python verify-setup.py` to diagnose problems
2. Check the backend logs in `Backend/app.log`
3. Verify all dependencies are installed
4. Ensure MongoDB is running if using local database
