# EduMaster Authentication & Security

## üîê Security Features Implemented

### Password Security
- **Minimum 8 characters** required
- **Complexity requirements**:
  - At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
  - At least one lowercase letter (a-z)  
  - At least one number (0-9)
  - At least one special character (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}...etc)
- **Secure hashing** using bcrypt with salt
- **Real-time password validation** in frontend

### Rate Limiting
- **5 login attempts maximum** per IP address
- **5-minute cooldown period** after exceeding limit
- **Automatic cleanup** of old attempt records
- **IP-based tracking** for security

### Input Validation
- **Email format validation** using regex patterns
- **Required field checks** on both frontend and backend
- **Input length limits** to prevent overflow attacks
- **Data sanitization** before database operations

### Database Security
- **MongoDB with secure connections**
- **No direct SQL injection vulnerabilities** (using MongoDB ODM)
- **User account status checking** (active/inactive)
- **Duplicate email/student ID prevention**

### CORS Configuration
- **Restricted origins** (localhost:3000 for development)
- **No wildcard origins** in production configuration
- **Proper HTTP methods** allowed

### Session Management
- **User authentication state** stored in localStorage
- **Automatic logout** on authentication failure
- **Session timeout** handling

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Development
- [x] Password complexity enforcement
- [x] Rate limiting implementation
- [x] Input validation and sanitization
- [x] Error handling without information leakage
- [x] Secure password hashing
- [x] CORS configuration

### For Production (Recommended)
- [ ] **HTTPS enforcement** (SSL/TLS certificates)
- [ ] **JWT tokens** for stateless authentication
- [ ] **Session expiration** with refresh tokens
- [ ] **Two-factor authentication (2FA)**
- [ ] **Account lockout** after multiple failed attempts
- [ ] **Password reset functionality** with secure tokens
- [ ] **Email verification** for new accounts
- [ ] **Security headers** (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- [ ] **Database encryption at rest**
- [ ] **API rate limiting** with Redis
- [ ] **Audit logging** for security events
- [ ] **Regular security scans** and updates

## üîç Current Security Test Results

### ‚úÖ Passing Tests
- Server connectivity and health
- User signup with valid data
- User login with correct credentials
- Duplicate email protection
- Invalid login rejection
- SQL injection protection
- CORS configuration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
- **Session Security**: No secure cookie flags (acceptable for development)
- **Password Security**: Consider additional complexity requirements
- **Rate Limiting**: Currently memory-based (use Redis for production)

## üö® Security Incident Response

### If you suspect a security breach:
1. **Immediately change passwords** for affected accounts
2. **Check application logs** for suspicious activity
3. **Monitor database** for unauthorized access
4. **Update security measures** as needed
5. **Report incidents** to the development team

## üìù Security Checklist for Deployment

### Before Going Live:
- [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure secure session cookies
- [ ] Set up proper environment variables
- [ ] Enable database authentication
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Test all security features
- [ ] Review and audit code
- [ ] Set up backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Create incident response plan

## üîß Configuration Files

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/
DATABASE_NAME=eduplanner
CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com

### Security Headers (Production)
```python
@app.after_request
def security_headers(response):
    response.headers['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'
    response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'DENY'
    response.headers['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'
    response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'
    return response
```

## üìû Contact & Support

For security concerns or questions:
- Review this documentation
- Run security tests: `python test_auth_security.py`
- Check application logs for security events
- Follow secure development practices

**Remember**: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regularly review and update security measures as needed.
