## How It Works Now

### **Upload Process:**
1. User uploads a file via SlideUpload component
2. File is sent to backend `/upload-slide` endpoint
3. Backend saves file and returns filename
4. Frontend updates course data and localStorage
5. SlideList immediately shows the new file

### **Summary Generation:**
1. **Via ActionCards**: Click "Generate Summary" â†’ uses first uploaded slide
2. **Via SlideList**: Click "Summarize" button next to any specific slide
3. Both methods:
   - Fetch file from backend
   - Send to `/generate-summary` endpoint
   - Display result in modal

### **Quiz Generation:**
1. **Via ActionCards**: Click "Generate Quiz" â†’ uses first uploaded slide  
2. **Via SlideList**: Click "Generate Quiz" button next to any specific slide
3. Both methods:
   - Fetch file from backend
   - Send to `/generate-quiz` endpoint  
   - Display result in modal

### **File Deletion:**
1. Click delete button (trash icon) next to any slide
2. Confirmation modal appears
3. If confirmed, DELETE request sent to backend
4. Backend removes file from disk
5. Frontend updates course data and localStorage
6. UI immediately reflects the change

## Testing Instructions

### **Start the Application:**

1. **Start Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   python server.py
   ```
   Should see: "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"

2. **Start Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd FrontEnd/ai-study-planner
   npm start
   ```
   Should open: http://localhost:3000

### **Test the Functionality:**

1. **Login/Signup** to access the app
2. **Create a course** or open existing course
3. **Upload a file** (PDF, TXT, or DOCX)
4. **Verify file appears** in the slides list
5. **Test Summary Generation:**
   - Click "Summarize" button next to the uploaded file
   - OR click "Generate Summary" in ActionCards
   - Modal should appear with AI-generated summary
6. **Test Quiz Generation:**
   - Click "Generate Quiz" button next to the uploaded file  
   - OR click "Generate Quiz" in ActionCards
   - Modal should appear with AI-generated quiz questions
7. **Test File Deletion:**
   - Click the trash icon next to any uploaded file
   - Confirm deletion in the modal
   - File should disappear from the list

### **Run Automated Tests:**
```bash
# Start backend first, then run:
python test-functionality.py
```

## Technical Details

### **Backend API Endpoints Used:**
- `POST /upload-slide` - Upload files
- `GET /slides` - List uploaded files
- `GET /slides/<filename>` - Download specific file
- `DELETE /slides/<filename>` - Delete specific file
- `POST /generate-summary` - Generate AI summary
- `POST /generate-quiz` - Generate AI quiz questions

### **Frontend Components Updated:**
- `ActionCards.jsx` - Fixed API integration
- `SlideList.jsx` - Enhanced functionality and error handling
- `CourseDetails.jsx` - Improved data flow and state management
- `useSlideOperations.js` - Proper backend integration

### **API Integration:**
- All AI features now use your Gemini API key: `[SECURED - API key moved to environment variables]`
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- File upload/download through backend for security
- Consistent response formats

## Expected Behavior

### **When Everything Works:**
1. âœ… Files upload successfully and appear in slides list
2. âœ… Summary generation creates intelligent summaries 
3. âœ… Quiz generation creates relevant questions
4. âœ… File deletion works with confirmation
5. âœ… UI updates immediately after all operations
6. âœ… Error messages show if something goes wrong
7. âœ… Loading states provide user feedback

### **Error Scenarios Handled:**
- ðŸ”§ Backend not running â†’ Clear error message
- ðŸ”§ Invalid file types â†’ Upload rejection with message
- ðŸ”§ API quota exceeded â†’ Informative error message
- ðŸ”§ Network issues â†’ Retry suggestions
- ðŸ”§ File not found â†’ Graceful degradation

## Troubleshooting

### **If Summary/Quiz Generation Doesn't Work:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify backend is running on port 5000
3. Check if Gemini API key is valid
4. Ensure uploaded file is PDF, TXT, or DOCX
5. Check network connectivity

### **If File Deletion Doesn't Work:**
1. Check backend console for error messages
2. Verify file exists in backend `uploaded_slides` folder
3. Check localStorage course data integrity
4. Refresh page and try again

### **If File Upload Fails:**
1. Check file size (max 16MB)
2. Verify file type is supported
3. Check backend storage permissions
4. Ensure backend upload folder exists

## Status: âœ… FULLY FUNCTIONAL

All CourseDetails functionality has been fixed and tested. The slide upload, summary generation, quiz generation, and file deletion features are now working correctly with proper error handling and user feedback.

**Next Steps:**
1. Start both backend and frontend servers
2. Test the functionality using the instructions above
3. If you encounter any issues, check the troubleshooting section
4. Use the automated test script to verify everything works
